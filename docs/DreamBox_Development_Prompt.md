# DreamBox AI System - Development Prompt

## Project Overview

DreamBox is an innovative, fully automated AI system that creates and manages a TikTok account dedicated to visualizing people's dreams. The system leverages OpenAI's Sora (or similar text-to-video AI models) to transform written dream descriptions into captivating visual content, which is then automatically posted to TikTok. DreamBox monitors comments on its videos for new dream descriptions, creating a self-sustaining content generation loop that turns viewer engagement into new content.

## System Requirements

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1 Content Generation Engine
- Integrate with Sora API or alternative text-to-video AI models
- Develop prompt optimization algorithms to transform casual dream descriptions into effective generation prompts
- Implement style consistency to maintain recognizable brand aesthetics
- Create content diversity controls to ensure variety in visual styles and themes
- Design content quality assurance mechanisms with fallbacks if generation quality is insufficient

#### 1.2 TikTok Automation System
- Develop secure API integration with TikTok for programmatic posting
- Build scheduled posting functionality with optimal timing based on audience analytics
- Implement caption generation that maintains brand voice and encourages dream submissions
- Create hashtag optimization based on trending topics and platform algorithms
- Design automated response system for common comment types

#### 1.3 Dream Collection Pipeline
- Develop comment scanning system that identifies and extracts dream descriptions
- Create natural language processing to filter and prioritize dreams based on visual potential
- Implement user attribution system to credit dream contributors
- Design community guidelines enforcement for submitted dream content
- Build dream queue management with prioritization algorithms

#### 1.4 Analytics & Learning System
- Implement engagement tracking across all content metrics (views, likes, shares, comments)
- Design machine learning models to identify patterns in high-performing content
- Create feedback loops that improve prompt engineering based on engagement data
- Develop trend identification for dream themes and visual preferences
- Build reporting dashboard for system performance monitoring

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### 2.1 System Infrastructure
- Cloud-based architecture with scalability for processing multiple video generations
- Queuing system for managing content generation pipeline
- Fault tolerance and redundancy for critical system components
- Secure API credential management for third-party services
- Efficient storage solution for video assets and metadata

#### 2.2 Database Design
- Dream repository with metadata (source, theme, generation parameters)
- Content library with generation history and performance metrics
- User engagement tracking with attribution to specific content
- System performance logging and optimization data
- Configuration management for system parameters

#### 2.3 Security & Compliance
- Content moderation systems for both inputs (dreams) and outputs (videos)
- Privacy protection for user-submitted content
- Compliance with TikTok's terms of service and API usage policies
- Age-appropriate content controls
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for data collection and processing

### 3. User Experience & Branding

#### 3.1 Account Identity
- Distinctive visual brand identity across profile and videos
- Consistent storytelling approach that frames dreams in engaging contexts
- Clear communication about the AI-powered nature of the account
- Community-building strategy that emphasizes shared dream experiences
- Engagement hooks that encourage dream submissions

#### 3.2 Content Presentation
- Video templates with recognizable intros/outros
- On-screen attribution for dream contributors ("Dream by @username")
- Visual watermarking that builds brand recognition
- Caption formats that frame the dream context engagingly
- Call-to-action strategy for increasing submissions

### 4. Ethical Considerations

#### 4.1 Content Policies
- Clear guidelines for acceptable dream content
- Filtering mechanisms for potentially harmful, disturbing, or inappropriate content
- Transparency about content moderation practices
- User reporting mechanisms for inappropriate content
- Human oversight for edge cases and policy development

#### 4.2 Attribution & Ownership
- Clear terms of service regarding intellectual property of submitted dreams
- Transparent attribution system for crediting dream contributors
- Opt-out mechanisms for users who change their mind
- Policy for handling multiple similar dream submissions
- Copyright compliance for all generated content
