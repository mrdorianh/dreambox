# DreamBox: AI-Powered Dream Visualization Platform

![DreamBox Logo](https://placeholder-for-dreambox-logo.com)

> *"Bringing dreams to life, one TikTok at a time."*

## Project Overview

DreamBox is an innovative AI system that autonomously manages a TikTok account dedicated to visualizing people's dreams. The system leverages OpenAI's Sora (or similar text-to-video AI models) to transform written dream descriptions into captivating visual content, creating a self-sustaining content generation loop that turns viewer engagement into new content.

### Key Features

- **Automated Dream Collection**: Extracts dream descriptions from TikTok comments
- **AI-Powered Visualization**: Transforms dreams into high-quality videos using Sora
- **Autonomous Publishing**: Schedules and posts content at optimal times
- **User Attribution**: Credits dream contributors in generated videos
- **Engagement Analytics**: Learns from viewer response to improve content
- **Content Safety**: Multi-layered approach to ensure appropriate content
